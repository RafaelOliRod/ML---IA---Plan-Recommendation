Megaline - Plan Recommendation Project

In the highly competitive telecommunications world, understanding and meeting customer needs is crucial for a company's success. Megaline, an established mobile operator, is striving to maintain its competitive position and better address the constantly changing demands of its customers. To achieve this goal, the company has decided to employ advanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence techniques to develop a model capable of recommending new phone plans to its customers.

In this project, we will explore a variety of Machine Learning algorithms and modeling techniques to create an intelligent system that analyzes customer behavior and suggests the most suitable plan for each individual. Using historical customer behavior data, our goal is to develop a robust and effective model that can accurately predict customer preferences and recommend plans that best meet their individual needs.

By leveraging the power of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, we hope to enable Megaline to make more informed strategic decisions, improve customer satisfaction, and drive business growth.
